<p align="Center"> Matrix System!

**Freq Fronters include:**<br/>
Wes (Albert), Scott, 12, Bucky, Quill, SpringTrap aka Will.<br/>

**If You're unsure who's fronting:**<br/>
Calling us Wes or Wessa (IF WE'RE FRIENDS) is fine. <br/>
He/Him or They/Them pronouns are fine **unless told differently**.<br/>

**Other Things To Note:** <br/>
Usually, but not always, we'll have a link that isn't 'EscortingMen' if someone else is fronting. If that person doesn't have their own link then this one will be used.
Usually Scott and Albert front together. <br/>
We don't want to interact with other people 'just because we're systems' ...We do find it odd.<br/>
Depending on who's fronting they may use I/Me or We/Us.<br/>
Don't try to roleplay with us...It's incredibly weird to try to roleplay with systems.<br/>
We usually don't put SYS or INTRJ in our names because of how weird people on PT can be. <br/>
