<p align="Center"> Matrix System!

Freq Fronters include: Wes (Albert), Scott, 12, Bucky, Quill, SpringTrap aka Will.

**If You're unsure who's fronting:**
Calling us Wes or Wessa (IF WE'RE FRIENDS) is fine. 
He/Him or They/Them pronouns are fine **unless told differently**.

**Other Things To Note:** 
Usually, but not always, we'll have a link that isn't 'EscortingMen' if someone else is fronting. If that person doesn't have their own link then this one will be used.
Usually Scott and Albert front together. 
We don't want to interact with other people 'just because we're systems' ...We do find it odd.
Depending on who's fronting they may use I/Me or We/Us.
Don't try to roleplay with us...It's incredibly weird to try to roleplay with systems.
We usually don't put SYS or INTRJ in our names because of how weird people on PT can be.
